# Basic Java Concepts

This is a basic package in which I have tried to cover all the very basics java concepts,
(Starting form if-else going through wrapper class including some Advance topic and practice program also)
Which is required to understand OOP concepts in java (covered in the next package)

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## üìå Which concepts is included in this basic package ?
1. Decision Structures / Selections
2. Mathematical Functions, Characters, and Strings
3. Loops
4. Methods
5. Single-Dimensional Arrays
6. Multi-Dimensional Arrays
7. Text Processing and More about Wrapper Classes

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## üí° Package Contains (flow)::
1. very basic practice of concepts
2. intermediate example of above concepts
3. At last Advance practice of all the concepts learned :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------


## üõ†Ô∏è Program Structure ::
First line :: tells Question / explanation / About Program
Second line :: tells AIM / PRACTICE (concept)

For example : /*
              Program shows the ambiguous overloading of method
              AIM :: To know what is Ambiguous Overloading in Java
               */
               package basic_package;


Instruction ::
I have written all the programs in "package basic_package"
so you have to rename 'basic_package' by your package-name for going errorless

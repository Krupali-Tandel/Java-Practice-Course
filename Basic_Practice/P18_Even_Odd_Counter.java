/*
18 Even/Odd Counter
Write a program with a method named isEven that accepts an int argument. The method
should return true if the argument is even, or false otherwise. The programâ€™s main method
should use a loop to generate 100 random integers. It should use the isEven method to
determine whether each random number is even, or odd. When the loop is finished, the
program should display the number of even numbers that were generated, and the number
of odd numbers.
